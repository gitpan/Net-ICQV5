NAME
    `Net::ICQV5' - Net::ICQV5 is a Perl module that allows your Perl
    programs to send and receive ICQ messages.

SYNOPSIS
     use Net::ICQV5CD;
     $ICQ = new Net::ICQV5 ('icq4.mirabilis.com','4000');
     $ICQ->login($uin,$password) || die "Couldn't log on.";

DESCRIPTION
    Net::ICQV5 is a Perl module that allows your Perl programs to send and
    receive ICQ messages. Perhaps the most obvious use of Net::ICQ would be
    to write an ICQ client in Perl. Some other uses that people have come up
    with are:

    Allow a server or daemon to notify its administrator via ICQ when a
    critical error occurrs. Enable ICQ chat functionality where youd never
    thought of it before: MUDs, IRC bots, etc.
